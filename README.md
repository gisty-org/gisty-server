Gisty is an online meeting summariser. It works in combination with the gisty chrome extension which becomes a part of your meeting and generates a summary of it. This summary is saved in your account and you can view it from the Gisty website. The extension also supports voice-based screenshots with the `take snapshot` command. If your colleague missed a meeting, then you can share the summary directly him/her from the website.

## Features

- Live Transcription of Meetings
- AI - based Summarisation of transcript
- Voice - based Screenshots
- Organise your summaries into folders
- Easy and Unlimited Sharing
